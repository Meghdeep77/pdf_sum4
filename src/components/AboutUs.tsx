                PDF_SUM was brought to life by a student from the Manipal
                Institute of Technology, understanding first-hand the challenges
                of exam preparation. The founder's journey through university
                life inspired the creation of this platform, with the goal to
                ease the burden of exam prep and make learning more accessible
                and manageable.
